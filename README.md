## Welcome to my Github page with a dashboard exploring Covid19 in South Africa

I started this project making graphs to follow and explore the progression of Covid19 in South Africa. Once I did this I wanted to share it but as the the graphs were interactive web based plots I needed to make a web page to share it. Please feel free to comment and any feedback will be appreciated. 

### Data sources

The github pages for Johns Hopkins (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and the University of Pretoria (https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za) was used to draw the data from.

### Python

Plotly Dash was used for the Dashboard and was deployed using Google App Engin.
